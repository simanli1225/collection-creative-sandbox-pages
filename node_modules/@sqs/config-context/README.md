# `@sqs/config-context`

## Description

The goal `config-context` is to provide a shared way to enforce type safety when accessing `window.Static.SQUARESPACE_CONTEXT`.
We export both the type (`Context`) and a cached reference (`context`) to `window.Static.SQUARESPACE_CONTEXT` which can be imported and used to access the context without going through the `window` global.

This package is inspired by the `website-context` package, which is only intended for use within website/visitor pages (not /config)

## Reasoning

With more teams building out CMS features in rush packages, teams typically re-define the SQUARESPACE_CONTEXT type (or bypass typesafety using lodash.get).
