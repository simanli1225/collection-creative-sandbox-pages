# @sqs/i18n-cldr

## Overview

This library houses shared CLDR configurations and packs that power all international formatters on the Frontend.
Originally this has been provided within `@sqs/i18n-ui` but has been split out to for greater reuse. 

Under the hood, this package relies on `@phensley/cldr-compiler` to generate regional data based on an [internally maintained Squarespace config](./config.json)
