# @sqs/eslint-config-react

Provides the configuration for linting React JavaScript projects at Squarespace.

## Installation

The config package has a few peer dependencies.
You can install all of them (including the config package itself) with this shortcut:

```sh
npx install-peerdeps @sqs/eslint-config-react --registry https://artifactory.squarespace.net:443/artifactory/api/npm/npm-all/ --dev
```

## Usage

Add the following to your [ESLint config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring)
(assuming JSON format; adjust accordingly for JS):

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@sqs/react", /* You can use other presets as well, but consider making this one the last in the array so it has the chance to override any other parser config */
  ],
  ... /* Any other properties */
}
```

### Accessibility testing

Note that by default,
the preset adds some basic accessibility checks using [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).
Disabling them is not recommended.
