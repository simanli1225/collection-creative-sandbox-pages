# @sqs/i18n-locale-list

## Goal
Create an importable front-end package that defines the locales that Squarespace
supports.

**Note:** This package has a backend-focused Java equivalent in
[squarespace-i18n](https://github.com/sqsp/squarespace-i18n).
The locale exports in that library should be **manually** kept in sync with the
exports in this library until we can figure out a less brittle solution.

## Do not change the values without consulting the consuming teams
* If you change locales.member, consult #member-account.

## Publishing to NPM
