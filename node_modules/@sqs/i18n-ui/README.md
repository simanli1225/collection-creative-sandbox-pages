# @sqs/i18n-ui

## Overview

This library provides i18n utilities for formatting, translating and displaying
user interfaces. This library is a hard-fork from the [previous @sqs/i18n frontend
packages](https://code.squarespace.net/projects/WEBM/repos/sqs-i18n/browse) and
consolidates several of those libraries (@sqs/ast-utils, @sqs/i18n-formatters,
@sqs/globalize, @sqs/i18n-react) into a single new package, @sqs/i18n-ui.

The internationalization library that powers @sqs/i18n-ui is [cldr-engine](https://github.com/phensley/cldr-engine),
written by Pat Hensley (@phensley).

## Warning on `.native` files
Proceed with caution whenever deleting functions from `.native` files.

We've learned that in mobile applications (`squarespace-app`, in particular)
imports within this library, when compiled through the React Native Metro Bundler,
(Ex. "`import { renderComponentWithChildren } from './renderComponent';`") will resolve to
`.native` files. So even though some functions may look unused, they are in use for mobile app consumers.

We've added warnings in `.native` files directly, as well as here in the README.
