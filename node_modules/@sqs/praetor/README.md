# Praetor Javascript Client

Javascript client for the Praetor feature toggle system. To make use of this client, you'll first need
a backend client set up (Java being the current option).

From your backend client, you should retrieve all features

```java
SubjectVariant variant = client.getAllFeatures(subject);
```

This variant object, encoded as JSON, can be passed to the Javascript client, through e.g. the DOM or an API call.

```javascript
import PraetorStaticClient from 'praetor'

const client = new PraetorStaticClient(configAsJson);

const default = false
const {enabled} = client.getFeatureToggle('my-feature-toggle', default)


const default = "blue"
const {variant} = client.getABTestVariant('button-color', default)
```

# Running tests

1. yarn install
2. yarn test
