# @sqs/febs-create

Scaffolding tool for creating projects based upon the FEBs example projects.

## Usage
The utility utilizes Plop under the hood to make an interactive scaffolding tool, that
accepts a series of answers, to customize the output project that is generated.

#### Basic Usage
The most common way this will be used is running the `create` CLI action, and following
the series of prompts in your terminal session.

```
# Run the tool
febs create

# Follow the interactive prompts
```

#### Arguments Usage
Many of the questions can be bypassed by passing command line arguments to your `febs create`
command, using the following construct:

```
febs create --ARGUMENT_NAME=ARGUMENT_VALUE
```

An example command utilizing this to bypass the package name and description questions would
look like:

```
febs create --name="@sqs/foo" --description="It is a package specializing in foo"
```

## Arguments

`name` {String} the resulting package name used in the package.json
`description` {String) the resulting description used in the package.json
`projectType` {"library"} one of the available example starter project groupings from the enum
`monorepoTool` {lerna|rush|none} what monorepo tool is being used in the workspace within which the 
package is being created
`directory` {String} relative path from cwd into which to scaffold your project - results in pathname
reflecting {directory}/{name}
```

Given these you may have a command that looks like:

```
febs create --directory=./packages --name="ui" --description="It represents UI components" --monorepoTool="none" --projectType="library"
```

Which would create you a project:

(1) Scaffolded from the FEBs example libary
(2) In the directory `./packages/ui` relative to your cwd
(3) Populate the package.json with `name` and `description` properties
(4) Remove the residual git reference from the example project of (1)
